 INTRODUCTION

PICT InC (Impetus and Concepts) is the flagship technical event of Pune Institute of Computer Technology. It is an international-level inter-collegiate competition designed to promote innovation, creativity, and technical excellence among engineering students. Over the years, InC has evolved from a small inter-departmental competition into a nationally and internationally recognized platform that attracts students, academicians, startups, and industry professionals.

InC bridges the gap between academia and industry by providing students with opportunities to present real-world projects, receive expert feedback, gain mentorship, and secure internships or job offers through direct interaction with industry leaders.

 OBJECTIVES OF InC
The objectives of InC are to provide a platform for emerging technical talent, encourage innovative thinking and problem-solving, facilitate meaningful interactions between students and industry professionals, promote entrepreneurship among students, and help participants transform academic projects into deployable real-world solutions.
